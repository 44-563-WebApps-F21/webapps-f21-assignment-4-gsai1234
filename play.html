            <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2> 

       <h4> The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house.  An Adam room.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  On the left, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  The fire is lit.  Phipps, the butler, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  He is a mask with a manner.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, history knows nothing.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.
    </h4>
        LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [Takes his hat, cane, and cape, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]

        LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.

        LORD GORING.  [Taking out old buttonhole.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  [Putting in a new buttonhole.]  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
